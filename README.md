# Molecule-vizualization
This project is made to vizualize molecules in 3D space using avogardro by using coordinates 
the following respository contains a jupyter file and a snapshot of molecule vizualization

#jupyter file 
the project is coded in python and all the dataset has been decoded from binary files

Data vizualizaiton contains the vizualization part of the project 
model file contains the trained machine learning model to predict the energies of the molecule using the coordinates of the molecules
text.xyz contains the molecules coordinates extracting from the files
